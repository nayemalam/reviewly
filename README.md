## Context

From a `reviews.json` file with the object structure like below: 
  
  ```typescript
  {
    "reviews": [
      {
        id: string,
        author: string,
        place: string,
        published_at: string,
        rating: number,
        content: string,
      },
    ]
  }
  ```

  You are able to do the following with this application (+ some extras):
- A view with a list of reviews
  - Review rating is visible
  - Review published_at is visible
  - Review author is visible
- A view with a reviewâ€™s complete details
- A user can add a response to a review
  - A review can only have one response
  - A response can be edited
  - A response should be shown with the rest of the review details

Deployed version available at: https://reviewly-response.netlify.app

## Getting Started

- Clone this repo: `https://github.com/nayemalam/reviewly.git`

```bash
cd reviewly
yarn
# or
npm i
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Unit testing
  ```bash
  npm run test:unit
  # or
  yarn test:unit
  ```
> Unit test in this application tests whether a component renders the correct content. It does not test the functionality of the component. Usually I would test service functions and other utility functions. But since this is a small application, I have not done that.


## e2e testing
  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e
  # or
  yarn test:e2e
  ```

> Note: in order to run e2e tests, you must first have the local/dev server running (via `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`)

## Note
- Tested on Chrome Version 105.0.5195.125 (Official Build)
- Architecture implemented with proper file structuring
- UI and logic implemented (values stored in Local Storage)
- Some other nice features implemented: 
  - responsive design
  - typescript
  - clear all comments with  prompt
    - this will clear only all responses, not the entire local storage
  - back button for convenience
  - press "Shift + Enter" to submit a comment
  - can cancel and edit the comment
  - can remove a comment
  - added a global "All" and "Unanswered" filter option
  - deployed with CI (every push to `master` will automatically deploy to deployed URL)
  - added unit tests (in `__tests__/` folder)
  - added e2e tests (in `e2e/` folder)
  - added 404 page to catch all other routes
- Built with Next.js, React, Redux + Redux Toolkit, styled with SASS, Tailwind CSS and Material UI. Testing with JEST + React Testing Library for unit tests and e2e tests with Playwright.

## Some other things to consider (but out of scope):
- instead of saving responses in local storage, should actually save them in db (via POST or graphql query)
- currently do not have a fetching state but that's expected since it retrieves from localStorage
- it is a bit overkill to add redux global state management in the current app as it is since it is unnecessary (however, it's nicely implemented for whenever we do require a global store, it will be there)
- don't need all of Tailwind + SASS + MUI, could have just built this app with only one preprocessor/component library
- justification on why I used the above 3 together:
   - SASS: for any overrides, as well as local theme + custom css
   - Tailwind: out of box utility classes (displaying flex, text size, etc)
   - MUI: Premade components (i.e. Button, Tooltip, Popper, etc)
- could have added an option to upload a `reviews.json` file, since it was given in a file format - decided to do this because realistically you're not uploading reviews, rather fetching them
- could have created more filter functions that manipulate local reviews state (sort by reviews, date), filter by name, etc
  - currently I've added a filter by "All" and "Unanswered" filter
- current user admin is hardcoded but this can be easily fetched from auth login and have an AuthContext surrounding the entire app - out of scope
- unit tests: aren't really doing the best here, usually I do unit tests on service calls or to check if a function is executing as expected
